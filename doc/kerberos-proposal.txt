--- Kerberos-client module proposal

While we have new authentication dialog, where user can choose sets of users
and type authetication, there is a chance to manage various auth. types.

So here comes ... the kerberos-client module!

--- What is it for?

To set just a basic settings of Kerberos client, the first version is good for
learning Kerberos principes.

- 1. Configuration of client:

This is done via /etc/krb5.conf file, so the YaST2 module has to enable some 
change of this file.

- 2. Authentification with kerberes

For this, the pam_krb5 module is used. User should be able to set 
    - if he wants to use this module
    - how should it work (primary or optional authenication etc.)

--- Workflow

It is simple. Let's use only one dialog, where the minimal settings should be
shown. These are:

- use pam_krb5 for auth. (radiobuttons)
- which way? (combobox)

- configuration of client, necessary values are
    - realm
    - server adress

--- Future

- use two dialogs: for PAM and client configuration

- PAM: choose the files to modificate, choose the options

- client: more variables
